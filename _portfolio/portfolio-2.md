Biologically Inspired Artificial Intelligence (BIAI) refers to computational models and algorithms that emulate the structure, function, and adaptive capabilities of biological neural systems, particularly those observed in neuroscience. By leveraging principles such as neural connectivity, plasticity, sensory integration, and learning dynamics, BIAI seeks to replicate the brainâ€™s mechanisms for perception, decision-making, and adaptation. These biologically grounded approaches enable robotic and autonomous systems to exhibit more natural, robust, and flexible behaviors when operating in complex, uncertain, or dynamic environments.
