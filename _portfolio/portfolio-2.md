Biologically Inspired Artificial Intelligence (BIAI) refers to computational models that are designed to emulate the structure and function of biological neural systems, particularly those found in neuroscience. By drawing inspiration from the brainâ€™s and neural's mechanisms for processing information, learning, and adaptation, BIAI aims to enable intelligent behaviors in robotic systems. These models often replicate features such as neural connectivity, plasticity, and sensory integration, allowing robots to perceive, reason, and act more naturally and autonomously in complex environments.
