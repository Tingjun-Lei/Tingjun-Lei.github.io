The Hodgkin Huxley model of neurons is an extraordinary feat of physiological modeling and also an important model in computational neuroscience. 
In essence, the Hodgkin-Huxley model describes the dynamics of neurons as circuits with currents that are activated and deactivated at different time scales and at different voltages.
Thus, the discrete topographically organized neural networks with nonlinear analog neurons are derived for the trajectory planning of autonomous robots.
Each neuron is locally connected with adjacent neurons to transmit neural activities to each other, and its receptive field is regarded as a circular area with a radius.
