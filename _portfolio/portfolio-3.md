Having a team of robots, an efficient allocation of exploration targets among the team is a natural way how to reduce the required time to collect information about an unknown environment. 
Multi-Robot Task Allocation (MRTA) is a complex problem especially when it comes to heterogeneous unreliable robots equipped with different capabilities that are required to perform various tasks with different requirements
and constraints in an optimal way.
