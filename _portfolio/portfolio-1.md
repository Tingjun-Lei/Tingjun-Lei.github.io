By combining human expertise with robot’s autonomy in a team, human-autonomy teaming (HAT) is defined by the team dynamics, rather than by the human or machines alone. HAT may promote better performance, especially when there is a high degree of uncertainty in exploration. This research related to integrated human/autonomy systems at multiple scales and includes areas such as cognitive engineering of autonomous agents; design for human and autonomy interaction; technological aids for human-autonomy interaction; human-autonomy interaction modeling, testing, and evaluation; and fundamental issues of measurement and modeling of human-autonomy performance in engineered systems.
